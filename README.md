# Chat-Gradio-Gguf
![banner_image](media/project_banner.jpg)
<br>Status: Beta - See `Development` section..

## Description
Intended as a high-quality chat interface programmed towards windows 10 non-WSL, with any Cpu/Gpu on GGUF models. Dynamic prompting from keywords in models enabling better, interface and prompts, for relating theme of session, With some features but no imposed, limitations or guidelines. This tool providing local, uncensored, and inference with features that enhance productivity and usability, even a comparable interface, found on premium AI services, or as far in that direction as gguf models, will allow. The configuration is without options reported to make no difference on most models, ensuring a comprehensive yet streamlined experience.

### Features
- **Comprihensive CPU/GPU Support**: CPUs x64-CPU/AVX2/AVX512 and GPUs AMD/nVIDIA/Intel, with dropdown list selection supporting multi CPU/GPU setup.
- **Research-Grade Tools**: Includes RAG, web search, chunking, summarization, TOT, no-THINK, and code formatting, and with file attachments. 
- **Common File Support**: Handles `.bat`, `.py`, `.ps1`, `.txt`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.psd1`, `.xaml`, and other common formats of files.
- **Configurable Context**: Set model context to 8192-138072, and batch output to 1028-4096.
- **Enhanced Interface Controls**: Load/unload models, manage sessions, shutdown, and configure settings.
- **Highly Customizable UI**: Configurable; 10-20 Session History slots, 2-10 file slots, Session Log 400-550px height, 2-8 Lines of input. 
- **Speak Summaries**: Click `Say Summary` for a special prompt for a concise spoken summary of the generated output. Text to speak uses `PyWin32`.
- **Attach Files**: Attach Files is complete raw input, there is no Vectorise Files anymore, so the files should ideally be small enough to fit in context. 
- **Collapsable Left Column**: Like one would find on modern AI interface, but with concise 3 button interface for commonly used buttons. 
- **ASynchronous Response Stream**: Separate thread with its own event loop, allowing chunks of response queued/processed without blocking Gradio UI event loop.
- **Reasoning Compatible**: Dynamic prompt system adapts handling for reasoning models optimally, ie, uncensored, nsfw, chat, code.
- **Virtual Environment**: Isolated Python setup in `.venv` with `models` and `data` directories.

## Requirements
- Windows 10/11 - Its a Windows program, it may be linux compatible later (not now).
- Llama.Cpp - Options here for, Avx2, Vulkan, Kompute, Cuda 11, Cuda 12.
- Python => 3.8 (tested on 3.11.0) - Libraries used = Gradio, LangChain, llama-cpp-python, FAISS.
- Llm Model - You will need a Large Language Model in GGUF format, See `Models` section.
- Suitable CPU/GPU - Gpu may be, Main or Compute, with VRam 2-64GB, testing on rx470 in Compute.  

### Instructions
1. Download a "Release" version, when its available, and unpack to a sensible directory, like, `C:\Program_Filez\Chat-Gradio-Gguf` or `C:\Programs\Chat-Gradio-Gguf`. 
2. Right click the file `Chat-Gradio-Gguf.bat`, and `Run as Admin`, the Batch Menu will then load, then select `2` from the Batch Menu, to begin installation. You will be prompted to select a Llama.Cpp version to install, which should be done based on your hardware. After which, the install will begin, wherein Python requirements will install to a `.\venv` folder. After the install completes, check for any install issues, you may need to install again if there are.
3. You will then be returned to the Batch Menu, where you, now and in future, select `1` to run to run `Chat-Gradio-Gguf`. You will then be greeted with the `Interaction` page, but you will first be going to the `Configuration` page. 
4. On the `Configuration` page you would configure appropriately, its all straight forwards, but remember to save settings and load model. If the model loads correctly it will say so in the `Status Bar` on the bottom od the display.
- VRAM dropdown, 1GB to 32GB in steps, this should be your FREE ram available on the selected card.
5. Go back to the `Interaction` page and begin interactions, ensuring to notice features available, and select appropriately for your, specific model and use cases.
6. When all is finished, click `Exit` on the bottom right and/or close browser-tabs/terminals, however you want to do it.

### Notation 
- We use a calculation of `1.125`, the calculation is `TotalVRam /((ModelFileSize * 1.125) / NumLayers = LayerSize) = NumLayersOnGpu`.
- For downloading large files such as LLM in GGUF format, then typically I would use  [DownLord](https://github.com/wiseman-timelord/DownLord), instead of lfs.
- This project is for a chat interface, and is not intended to overlap with my other projects, `Rpg-Gradio-Gguf`, or the blueprints for, `Code-Gradio-Gguf` or `Agent-Gradio-Gguf`.
- Afterthought Countdown is, <25 characters then 1s or 26-100 charactrs then 3s or >100 lines then 5s, cooldown before proceeding, enabling cancelation relative to input.

### Models (Confirmed Working)
You will of course need to have a `*.Gguf` model, here are some good ones at the time, with gpt for comparrisson..

# Current
1. Qwen 3 and Deepseek 3, compatibility/integration/features. Make test script for both had issues, instead make individual test scripts, just getting one of them working first may be in order.
2. Need to simplify streaming, I want it character by character instead of chunking into words/sentences, so as to simplify. As a result hopefully remove occurences of no response until the complete thing is outputted, just print it how it comes, subject to whatever filters are present.
3. There is no stop button.

# Distant
1. **Safe Globals** - Standardize all global variables using safe, unique three-word labels to avoid conflicts.  
2. **Cross-Platform Scripting:** Introduce a unified script (`Chat-Gradio-Gguf.sh`) to support both Linux and Windows environments, and adapt scripts appropriately. 
3. Introduce a collapseable right side bar, lilke the left one but on the right, again a "C-G-G" button, that expands out to a "Chat-Gradio-Gguf" button, in the expanded panel here I want...
- a row with a square box, that visualizes the thinking/generation, in some simple method, that is somehow interesting, and under that, a row with a buttton to turn "Visualize" ON/OFF.
- a row with 3 boxes each with 1 stat for generation speed/whatever else is typically of interest to people.
- a row with 2 butttons, 1 to turn "Visualize" ON/OFF and 1 to turn "Statistics" on/off. Same kind of on/off buttons as web-Search/Speech/Summary.
- sliders for, context size and batch size, affecting them will affect the ones on the configuration page, and vice versa. They use the same global in temporary. we would then need to ensure that whatever settings are selected on either/both, will then be active for when the next time the user clicks send.
